# Listening exercise

## Guitar listening
### Mic Position: close
1. Cardioid: Position One was located right next to the guitar. The guitar was loud and blew out the mic on hard strums and causes distortion
2. Omni: The mic has more distortion. Rakes on guitar sound ok but with strumming sound becomes distorted.
### Mic Position: close 2
1. Omni: can hear guitar clearly, no distortion..
2. Cardioid: Guitar is more soloed, meaning it is easier to hear, no distortion within the recording, maybe a little on the hard strums
### Mic Position: close 3
1. Cardioid:  Sounds good, strums are loud and deep, a little distortion on the hard strums. raking heard clearly
2. Omni: Way more distortion, can hear the 'room' more. (reverb)
### Mic Position: Medium distance
1. Omni: Can hear the room, background buzzing, guitar sounds good. No distortion within recording
2. Cardioid Guitar is center to recording, can hear some reverb from the room. Guitar is loud and clear with little to no distortion.
### Mic Position: Far distance
1. Omni: Can hear the room, background buzzing, refrigerator? heater? Can hear the room easily. Room noise is very noticeable
2. Cardioid: Room noise is less noticeable, guitar is more centered to the recording. No distortion from guitar sound. Better recording to the guitar vs. Omni.

## Soundscape listening
### Greenough Park
We decided to record in the park hoping to get some cool and interesting sounds, but the timing and weather did not work in our favor. We had to record in the rain, which at first would seem interesting but it ended up being one of the only things I could hear.
1. In our first recording I noticed, the rain, the rain hitting the roof, the water dripping from the roof onto the concrete, the creek in the distance, and car engines from far off. In the recording I can definitely hear the cars driving on the road nearby. I also think I hear the creek but it mixes in with the background rain. 
2. We took this recording a little closer to the creek hoping to get a different sound. We ended up putting an umbrella over the mic to protect it from the rain. I could hear the rain hitting the umbrella, the creek, cars from the road, rain hitting the trees, the trees rustling, and the rain itself. In the recording the rain is pretty overpowering. I can hear that, the rain falling on the umbrella near the mic, the creek is very noticeable in this position, and I can hear cars drive by on the road.
